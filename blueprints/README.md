# Project Blueprints

Use this directory to store all detailed specifications, requirements, wireframes, and architectural designs for **Proyecto Ventas**.

## proper content for this folder:
- **Requirements**: `.md` files detailing features and user stories.
- **Architecture**: Diagrams (Mermaid, images) showing system design.
- **Database Schema**: SQL or text descriptions of data models.
- **UI/UX**: Wireframes or mockups.

Having these files here will help me (the AI) understand precisely what to build.
